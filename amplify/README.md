1. in this repository in the path 
```
/amplify/backend/auth/portfoliosofiaesc6a68432a/assets
``` 
make sure you upload all the files to the bucket named as `<app_name>verificationbucket-<env>`
(replace `<env>` with your amplifye env name and <app_name> with your assigned name in amplify)

```
const bucketUrl = `https://s3.${region}.amazonaws.com/${resourcePrefix}verificationbucket-${process.env.ENV}/index.html`;
